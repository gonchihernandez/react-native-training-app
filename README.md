# React Native Training App

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Native Training App project! This README file provides an overview of the project and outlines the next steps to be completed.

The project is built using Expo, React Native, React Native Navigation, Formik and Yup.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

### `npm install` / `yarn install`

## Then

Run The App

### `npm start` / `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm run ios` / `yarn ios`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android` / `yarn android`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
